                 <h2>About me</h2>   
                 <h3>These are my interests</h3>
                 <p>I love being around animals. This year is my 
                    first year showing and im going to show goats
                    and rabbits. Im kind of nervous but thats ok 
                    i also love trucks. I really like big lifted trucks
                    because they just really sound loud and good
                    when they are lifted and i just love trucks.
                    i also like volleyball, actually today i'm going
                    to an open gym for volleyball to practice
                    volleyball and football are my main interests. Im not your 
                    normal type of girl, i prefer things like going mudding 
                    and riding horses than painting nails or being afraid of mud.
                    I also love teh color blue. To me blue is just such a beautiful
                    color. I love being around my cousin colton because it seem slike
                    everytime im with him everything just goes away and everything
                    seems to runsmoother because i just have all the fun in the world when i am 
                    with my cousins mainly just colton though. Now heres one thing you should know when you put
                    me and my cousins keirsten and her brother colton together all at once 
                    o boy your in for it because oh boy do we go crazy. And also if you mess
                    with one of us you get all 3. You never mess with a cheney nor stanford
                    because you will not want to deal with all my family. 
                    Im very new to coding and im not the best but its getting better day by day
                    now im gonna be honest i dont really like coding but we have to do it so its not 
                    really my choice so i try my best. The projects i've done are
